Blog API
*********

The Blog API is, unlike other APIs, not a part of the LineAPI. This is because Wordpress (the Blog/Homepage backend) offers an excellent API for accessing blog and page entries as well as metadata and media. So the API request on api/blog redirects to https://line-lan.net/wp-json/ .
