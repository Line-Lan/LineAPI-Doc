Basics
------

The only real requirement for the usage of the LineAPI is that your Client must have a active internet connection and must be able to recieve data via HTTP/HTTPS.

Https
-----
.. tip::
   Although a HTTPS connection is not required for combatibility reasons, we highly encourage you to send all data via a secure connection.

A explode()-like method
-----------------------

Although it is not a requirement, your programming language should have a function that is able to create a array from a string by dividing it at a specified character, in our case a comma. This is useful when working with RAW-Data.

.. note::
	You can find more information about our Syntax in the :doc:`Syntax <syntax>` section

Recommendations
---------------

If you are new to programming and scripting, we recommend that you try php as it's easy to learn and relatively simple. php is pre-installed on most web-servers, so building your own application based on the LineAPI should be no problem.

  You can find the php-manual at http://php.net/manual
